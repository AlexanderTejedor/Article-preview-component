## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

I liked it, it's a very interesting challenge because I had to use react states to get the expected results, such as modifying the css values ​​with TailwindCSS just when the onClick event was handled.

### Continued development

I will continue improving my skills with React and TailwindCSS to keep growing.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
- [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com/) - This helped me to the add icons in my website.
